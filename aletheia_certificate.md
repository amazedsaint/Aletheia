# Aletheia Belief Certificate (prototype)

Date: 2025-08-21T06:21:23.497665Z

## Claim A (Correctness): quicksort_3way sorts correctly

**Domain:** Arrays length 0..12 with values in [0,9]
**Falsification budget:** 20000 random tests biased toward duplicates
**Result:** 0 failures observed
**Conservative 95% upper bound on failure probability:** 0.000150
**Verdict:** ✅ Emit sorted implementation (claim holds at tested power)

### Counterexample Found (Buggy Implementation)

The buggy quicksort that drops duplicates was caught with this input:
```
Input:  [0, 8, 3, 0, 1, 6, 6, 1, 3]
Output: [0, 1, 3, 6, 8]
```
❌ Missing duplicates - implementation rejected!

## Claim B (Performance): Quicksort beats mergesort on nearly-sorted arrays

**Result:** ❌ REFUTED
**Posterior mean success:** 0.001
**P(quicksort better > 50%):** 0.000
**Action:** Specialize selection to mergesort for nearly-sorted inputs

## Synthesized Design Rule

Based on distinctness ratio sweep:
```python
if distinctness_ratio(array) <= 0.040:
    use quicksort_3way  # Better for low-distinctness
else:
    use mergesort       # Better for high-distinctness
```

## Summary

This certificate provides evidence-based guarantees for the emitted code.
Unlike traditional compilation, these claims have been tested, not assumed.
